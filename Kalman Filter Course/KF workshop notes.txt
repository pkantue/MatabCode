% Kalman filter course - 16-17 July 2018

% Properties of a Kalman filter
% A Kalman filter is ultimately a low pass filter with explicit use of the problem knowledge.
% A Kalman filter allows you to design the problem with as many inputs as required. 
% Adaptive adaptive bandwidth
% Off-line performance analysis

Noise dynamics
% 1st and 2nd moments. Which means (mean of signal and mean of the square (variance) of the signal).
% Stationary (1st and 2nd moments are constants)
% Ergodicity (the assumption of the using mean over a period of time 

% Terminology
% Continuous case - use PSD or Intensity
% Discrete case - use Covariance

Given a discrete model of the step time T - the Nyquist frequency is -+ 1/2T 

Noise discrete
% for the linear system - the covariance of the state and output are of interest.
% Given the assumption that there's no correlation with current noise input and the white noise, 

% Covariance matrices are symmetric 
% Positive semi-definite 

The ensemble is only carried out with the notion that 
% Grewal and Andrews - implementing Kalman filters

% Kalman filter design
- (Time update) Prediction step has got to do with the prediction of estimate forward in time
- (Measurement update) update the future estimate with a gain to compute the current estimate
- The dynamics of the error covariance is correlate with the estimate.
- Optimality of the Kalman gain is derived from the minimizing the trace (sum squared of the diagonals of the Covariance matrix) with respect to the computed gain.
- The prediction output should be used even in the absence of the measurements.
- The Design of covariance measurement error can be computed without the use of measurements. This can be used for system engineering decisions (which sensors will be applicable for a particular requirement).

% Random constant model
- If one believes that a bias can be modelled as a random constant one should be aware that it could also be a slow real pole (next to your imaginary axis).
- When process noise is correlated one should bring the band limited dynamics that is driven by white noise. 
- The bandwidth of the filter is just (A-KH).

% Continuous filter
- This shows alot more intuition given that there's no two step update. 
- The optimal steady state Kalman gain results in a Wiener filter.

% Observability
- The ability to estimate X (state) from Z (measurement)
- This should be mandatory for optimal design of the state matrix and transition matrix.
- Without a full rank observability matrix (for a nonlinear model) the designer has to amend the state matrix.
- The Kalman filter doesn't guarantee immediately the stability of estimated states for an unstable system.

% Hybrid Model
- This represents the real world applications.
- Target tracking filter is an prime example.

% Nonlinear Kalman Filter
- 2nd order Kalman filter (extra term from the Taylor expansion equation).
- One of the major issues is the propagation of the covariance estimation.
- Propagation of the full state (A matrix) must be done with the nonlinear function.

% Unscented Kalman filter
- This has quite a few factors which are not very intuitive. More understanding is required.


IMPORTANT
- There's a place to introduce as much information about the model dynamics so that the initial conditions can be representative. This should be 
- A Kalman filter should be considered to have more states in the event there's unmodelled dynamics that might be seen as errors (propagated through a Kalman gain).
- The aim to initialize your the covariance error.
- The Q (process covariance) should be on the 'higher' side. This results in harder ramp in the Kalman gain between measurements.
- The R (measurement covariance) should be dependent on the sensor quality. Cheap sensor should be high (believe other sensors or estimates), Pricey sensor should be low (believe the measurements more).
